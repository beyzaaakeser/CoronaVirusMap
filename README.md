<h1>My Coronavirus Data Tracker: Global COVID-19 Tracking and Information Application </h1>

This project is a global COVID-19 data tracking application developed using React and Tailwind CSS. The application offers a comprehensive interface for users who want to track COVID-19 cases worldwide. While the homepage includes brief information about the effects of the coronavirus and ways to protect themselves, users are directed to more detailed guides on an external source via a button.

The interactive world map created with the React Simple Maps library allows users to select the country they want and view current COVID-19 data for that country. Data includes information such as country name, country code, number of confirmed cases, number of people recovered, number of deaths, last change, and last update dates. Data retrieved with the API is provided asynchronously using Axios and managed via a central state management with the Redux Toolkit.

Asynchronous actions and API requests are managed with Redux Thunk for performance optimization. The project also makes numerical data readable with Millify.

The application is designed to be fully responsive to work seamlessly on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and offers a flexible and modern user experience with Tailwind CSS.
